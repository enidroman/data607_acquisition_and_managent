## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

### 1. **Using the 173 majors listed in fivethirtyeight.comâ€™s College Majors dataset [https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/], provide code that identifies the majors that contain either "DATA" or "STATISTICS".**

```{r}
library(stringr)
```


```{r}
# I uploaded the csv dataset to my github where I created a repository for the dataset. I then uploaded the dataset to RStudio.

theUrl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/enidroman/data607_acquisition_and_managent/main/majors-list.csv"

college_major_list <- read.table(file=theUrl, header=TRUE, sep=",")
head(college_major_list)
```
 
```{r}
# I did a grep() function to search for matches of a pattern within each element of the given string.

data_stat <- college_major_list 
grep("DATA|STATISTICS", college_major_list$Major, value = TRUE)
```
 
### 2. **Write code that transforms the data below:**

## [1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"
## [5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  
## [9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    
## [13] "olive"        "salal berry"

## Into a format like this:

## c("bell pepper", "bilberry", "blackberry", "blood orange", "blueberry", "cantaloupe", "chili pepper", "cloudberry", "elderberry", "lime", "lychee", "mulberry", "olive", "salal berry") 

```{r}
# I created a dataframe for the input provide above. 

fruit_veg <- ('[1] "bell pepper"  "bilberry"     "blackberry"   "blood orange"
[5] "blueberry"    "cantaloupe"   "chili pepper" "cloudberry"  
[9] "elderberry"   "lime"         "lychee"       "mulberry"    
[13] "olive"        "salal berry"')
fruit_veg
```

```{r}
# I used the str_extract_all function to remove the backslash and the space before the second quotation from the begining of the string to the end. 

new_fruit_veg <- str_extract_all(fruit_veg, "\\w[a-z]+\\s?[a-z]+\\w")
new_fruit_veg
```

```{r}
# I used a collapse function to combine several cases into single lines. 

new_fruit_veg <- str_c(new_fruit_veg, collapse = ", ")
new_fruit_veg
```

```{r}
# I used the writeLines function to write the sequence of multiple lines to the text file.

writeLines(new_fruit_veg)
```

### 3. **Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:**

#### * (.)\1\1 - Repeat the chararacher in the first group, and then repeat that character again. ex. xxx or fff

```{r}
x <- c("abcdddef", "ggghijk", "lmnop")

str_view(x, "(.)\\1\\1", match = TRUE)
```
#### * "(.)(.)\\2\\1" - 1st character then a 2nd character followed by 2nd chararacter then a first character. ex. xyyx

```{r}
str_view_all(stringr::fruit, "(.)(.)\\2\\1", match = TRUE)
```
#### * (..)\1 -  2 charachters repeated twice. ex. xxyy or anan

```{r}
str_view_all(stringr::fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```

#### * "(.).\\1.\\1" - Character shows-up 3 times with one character between each. ex. x.x.x. 

```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "(.).\\1.\\1", match = TRUE)
```

#### * "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1" - 3 characters in one order with * character between, then 3 character with 3 letters in the reverse order of what it started. ex. xyz.*zyx 

```{r}
str_view(stringr::words, "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1", match = TRUE)
```

### 4. **Construct regular expressions to match words that:**

####  *  Start and end with the same character.

####  *  Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)

```{r}
str_subset(words, "^(.)((.*\\1$)|\\1?$)")
```

####  *  Contain a repeated pair of letters (e.g. "church" contains "ch" repeated twice.)

```{r}
str_subset(words, "([A-Za-z][A-Za-z]).*\\1")
```

####  *  Contain one letter repeated in at least three places (e.g. "eleven" contains three "e"s.)

```{r}
str_subset(words, "([a-z]).*\\1.*\\1")
```
